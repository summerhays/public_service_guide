## Montreal's public service
### Payscale
As far as I can tell, the general payscale does not appear to be public. 

That said, [this article](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/2024-01-07/salaires-a-la-ville-de-montreal/le-tiers-des-employes-gagnent-plus-de-100-000.php){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} from LaPresse (French only) indicates that over a third of city employees make more than $100,000 per year, and that Montreal is the highest paying of all of Québec's municipalities.

### How to apply
Creating an account on the [Montreal jobs site](https://simenligne.montreal.ca/OA_HTML/RF.jsp?function_id=1011483&resp_id=23350&resp_appl_id=800&security_group_id=0&lang_code=FRC&oas=rSvLYDMqayAWtsLWCBOPww..&params=a6EjML3ZJLL6jc9IJRywsII2.e81-3MIMil.fM4wNP0){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}  (French only) seems to be the way to go.


### Advantages
Note that the city of Montreal and the Federal government start employees with three weeks of vacation, whereas the Provincial government (Québec) begins with four weeks of vacation.

### Job types
Although Quebec and the city of Montreal have larger job categories (e.g. professional, technician), this doesn't seem to be the case for the federal government.
