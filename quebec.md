## Quebec public service
### Payscale
Quebec, like the city of Montreal, has a number of job categories. That said, most of them fall under about six categories:

1. Professional
2. Technician
3. Professor
4. Medical doctor
5. Administrative support
6. Trades

The payscale for the professionals will tend to be similar, as will the technicians etc.

Everyone's payscale is published on the [Quebec treasury website](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-humaines/conditions-de-travail-et-remuneration/echelles-de-traitement/echelles-de-traitement-en-vigueur/?no_cache=1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

One applies to a specific job, for instance AS-02, which will have a five step payscalei published on the [Treasury Website](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, published under [appendix 1](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=15#tocxx327742){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

For the given year, payscale will come in 4 steps, and the most one can make is the highest step.

Moving up to the next level (in this case, AS-03) requires applying for a different job with more responsibilities.

However each ministry seems to be slightly different. As an example with some classifications like Administrative Services (AS) it only goes up to like a 6, then one would apply for EX after to get an executive assistant job.

Level 04 tends to be Team Lead, 05 the coordinator who the leads would report to but their boss has a different classification. Despite PM going up higher, the big boss has financial budgeting of a very large amount. But smaller departments or projects could have a totally different set up.

There are over 150 or 200 classifications that include nurses, mechanics, lab scientists, policy advisors and they’re all different

There is also CR which seems to be administrative in others ministries but I haven’t learned enough to go much further into understanding the system or where to find the info. Someone should make a wiki.
