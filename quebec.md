## Quebec public service
### Payscale
Quebec, like the city of Montreal, has a number of job categories under which all its public service jobs fall:

1. Professional
2. Technician
3. Professor
4. Medical doctor
5. Administrative support
6. Trades

The payscale for the professionals will tend to be similar to each other. So for instance, [agronomists](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/echelles-salariales/f?p=ESAL_DIFFUSION:2:8141727167412:::2:P2_CLE_CORPS,P2_PAGE_APPEL:509-,1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and [architects](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/echelles-salariales/f?p=ESAL_DIFFUSION:2:8141727167412:::2:P2_CLE_CORPS,P2_PAGE_APPEL:512-,1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, both professionals, are on the exact same payscale. Other professionals are paid slightly less, such as [translators](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/echelles-salariales/f?p=ESAL_DIFFUSION:2:8141727167412:::2:P2_CLE_CORPS,P2_PAGE_APPEL:528-,1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, while [lawyers](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/echelles-salariales/f?p=ESAL_DIFFUSION:2:8141727167412:::2:P2_CLE_CORPS,P2_PAGE_APPEL:518-,1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} are paid slightly more, but within a similar range. Same applies for the technicians.

Everyone's payscale is published on the [Quebec treasury website](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-humaines/conditions-de-travail-et-remuneration/echelles-de-traitement/echelles-de-traitement-en-vigueur/?no_cache=1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

### Pay raise
Quebec, to its credit, tends to have a larger salary range than most positions in the federal government. For instance, many professional positions start at echelon 1 (bachelor's degree, no experience), at about $48,000 per year. However, echelon 18 is approximately $90,000 per year. Many jobs in the federal government have a higher starting salary but a lower ceiling. For instance, AS-02 starts at 61,152$ per year but maxes out at only 65,887$.

### Quebec's examination system
For a long time, Quebec had a rather cryptic system of public exams for professional positions. People who passed the exam could be placed in reserve pools for hiring. Quebec would only hire people who had passed the exam, and one had to wait for an examination posting, and then apply to the posting. It was byzantine. Fortunately, Quebec is getting rid of this odd system. Now, people who haven't passed the exam will be hired for a one-year contract, the exam will be administered on work hours. Once the exam has been passed, one can begin earning vacation and sick benefits, but also must start paying into the Quebec public service's expensive and meagre employee benefits.
