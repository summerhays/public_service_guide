## Quebec public service
### Payscale
Quebec, like the city of Montreal, has a number of job categories. That said, most of them fall under about six categories:

1. Professional
2. Technician
3. Professor
4. Medical doctor
5. Administrative support
6. Trades

The payscale for the professionals will tend to be similar, as will the technicians etc.

Everyone's payscale is published on the [Quebec treasury website](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-humaines/conditions-de-travail-et-remuneration/echelles-de-traitement/echelles-de-traitement-en-vigueur/?no_cache=1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

### Pay raise
Quebec, to its credit, tends to have a larger salary range than most positions in the federal government. For instance, many professional positions start at echelon 1 (bachelor's degree, no experience), at about $48,000 per year. However, echelon 18 is approximately $90,000 per year. Many jobs in the federal government have a higher starting salary but a lower ceiling.

### Quebec's examination system
For a long time, Quebec had a rather cryptic system of public exams for professional positions. People who passed the exam could be placed in reserve pools for hiring. Quebec would only hire people who had passed the exam, and one had to wait for an examination posting, apply to the posting. It was byzantine. Fortunately, Quebec is getting rid of this odd system. Now, people who haven't passed the exam will be hired for a one-year contract, the exam will be administered on work hours, and Quebec's meagre and fairly expensive employee benefits can then be distributed.
