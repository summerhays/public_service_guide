## Quebec public service
### Payscale
Quebec, like the city of Montreal, has a number of job categories. That said, most of them fall under about six categories:

1. Professional
2. Technician
3. Professor
4. Medical doctor
5. Administrative support
6. Trades

The payscale for the professionals will tend to be similar, as will the technicians etc.

Everyone's payscale is published on the [Quebec treasury website](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-humaines/conditions-de-travail-et-remuneration/echelles-de-traitement/echelles-de-traitement-en-vigueur/?no_cache=1){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

### Pay raise
For the first 9 echelons or so, there are two pay raises per year (every 6 months). After that, it's one echelon per year, or about $2,000 per year. 

Quebec, to its credit, tends to have a larger salary range than most positions in the federal government. For instance, many professional positions start at echelon 1 (bachelor's degree, no experience), at about $48,000 per year. However, echelon 18 is approximately $90,000 per year.
