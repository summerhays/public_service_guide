## Westmount's public service
### Payscale
As far as I can tell, the general payscale does not appear to be public. 

That said, as mentioned in the [general considerations](/general), cities in Quebec tend to be well paying.

### How to apply
Creating an account on the [Westmount jobs site](https://westmount.org/en/careers-2/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} seems to be the way to go.

### Advantages
Westmount may be the best available job for anglophones in town.
