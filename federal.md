## Federal public service
### Payscale
One applies to a specific job, for instance AS-02, which will have a five step payscalei published on the [Treasury Website](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, published under [appendix 1](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=15#tocxx327742){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

For the given job type, the payscale will come in 4 steps; the most one can make is the highest step.

Moving up to the next level (in this case, AS-03) requires applying for a different job with more responsibilities.

However each ministry seems to be slightly different. As an example with some classifications like Administrative Services (AS) it only goes up to like a 6, then one would apply for EX after to get an executive assistant job.

There is also CR which seems to be administrative in others ministries but we haven’t learned enough to go much further into understanding the system or where to find the info.

Level 04 tends to be Team Lead, 05 the coordinator who the leads would report to but their boss has a different classification. Despite PM going up higher, the big boss has financial budgeting of a very large amount. But smaller departments or projects could have a totally different setup.

There are over 150 or 200 classifications that include nurses, mechanics, lab scientists, policy advisors and they’re all different

### Pay raise
The salary goes up by about $5,000 per level. But within each level there are multiple steps. After a year of work you automatically get a pay raise of around $3,000, up to 4 years I think. At the 5th year, only more vacation time.

### Advantages
Although the municipal government pays better overall, the Federal government offers more flexibility in terms of where one can work within Canada, and more opportunities to work abroad as well.

Many work environments in city governments are notoriously toxic as well.

The federal government has more advantageous pay for professionals early in their career. A recent graduate for instance can make ~72,000$. However, as mentioned above, there are only four pay raises of a few thousands dollars. The provincial government starts lower but ends higher, rewarding longevity in the position.

### Job types
Although Quebec and the city of Montreal have larger job categories (e.g. professional, technician), this doesn't seem to be the case for the federal government.

Another job type to note is "casual," "term," and "indeterminate." Casual means a contract of less than 90 days. A term appointment or contract is temporary but longer, whereas an indeterminate contract is a permanent position (i.e. hard to fire). The Quebec government refers to these as *occasionnel* (term) and *permanent* (avec droit de rappel).

## Hiring delays
One factor to consider is hiring delays. The group writing this knows several people who've encountered delays of longer than a year before being hired by the federal government, not to mention jobs being offered and then retracted, paperwork (security clearance, confidentiality agreements, etc). Expect the unexpected.
