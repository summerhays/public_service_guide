        <section id="main-content">
          <h2 id="federal-public-service">Federal public service</h2>
<h3 id="payscale">Payscale</h3>
<p>One applies to a specific job, for instance AS-02, which will have a five step payscalei published on the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Treasury Website</a>, published under <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=15#tocxx327742" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appendix 1</a>.</p>

<p>For the given job type, the payscale will come in 4 steps; the most one can make is the highest step.</p>

<p>Moving up to the next level (in this case, AS-03) requires applying for a different job with more responsibilities.</p>

<p>However each ministry seems to be slightly different. As an example with some classifications like Administrative Services (AS) it only goes up to like a 6, then one would apply for EX after to get an executive assistant job.</p>

<p>There is also CR which seems to be administrative in others ministries but we haven’t learned enough to go much further into understanding the system or where to find the info.</p>

<p>Level 04 tends to be Team Lead, 05 the coordinator who the leads would report to but their boss has a different classification. Despite PM going up higher, the big boss has financial budgeting of a very large amount. But smaller departments or projects could have a totally different setup.</p>

<p>There are over 150 or 200 classifications that include nurses, mechanics, lab scientists, policy advisors and they’re all different</p>

<h3 id="pay-raise">Pay raise</h3>
<p>The salary goes up by about $5,000 per level. But within each level there are multiple steps. After a year of work you automatically get a pay raise of around $3,000, up to 4 years I think. At the 5th year, only more vacation time.</p>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<p>Although the municipal government pays better overall, the Federal government offers more flexibility in terms of where one can work within Canada, and more opportunities to work abroad as well.</p>

<p>Many work environments in city governments are notoriously toxic as well.</p>

<h3 id="job-types">Job types</h3>
<p>Although Quebec and the city of Montreal have larger job categories (e.g. professional, technician), this doesn’t seem to be the case for the federal government.</p>

<h2 id="hiring-delays">Hiring delays</h2>
<p>One factor to consider is hiring delays. The group writing this knows several people who’ve encountered delays of longer than a year before being hired by the federal government.</p>
