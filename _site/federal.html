<h3 id="payscale">Payscale</h3>
<p>One applies to a specific job, for instance AS-02, which will have a five step payscalei published on the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Treasury Website</a>, published under <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=15#tocxx327742" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appendix 1</a>.</p>

<p>For the given year, payscale will come in 4 steps, and the most one can make is the highest step.</p>

<p>Moving up to the next level (in this case, AS-03) requires applying for a different job with more responsibilities.</p>

<p>However each ministry seems to be slightly different. As an example with some classifications like Administrative Services (AS) it only goes up to like a 6, then one would apply for EX after to get an executive assistant job.</p>

<p>Level 04 tends to be Team Lead, 05 the coordinator who the leads would report to but their boss has a different classification. Despite PM going up higher, the big boss has financial budgeting of a very large amount. But smaller departments or projects could have a totally different set up.</p>

<p>There are over 150 or 200 classifications that include nurses, mechanics, lab scientists, policy advisors and they’re all different</p>

<p>There is also CR which seems to be administrative in others ministries but I haven’t learned enough to go much further into understanding the system or where to find the info. Someone should make a wiki.</p>

<h3 id="pay-raise">Pay raise</h3>
<p>The salary goes up by about $5,000 per level. But within each level there are multiple steps. After a year of work you automatically get a pay raise of around $3,000, up to 4 years I think. At the 5th year, only more vacation time</p>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<p>Although the municipal government pays better overall, the Federal government offers more flexibility in terms of where one can work within Canada, and more opportunities to work abroad as well.</p>

<p>Many work environments in city governments are notoriously toxic as well.</p>

<h3 id="job-types">Job types</h3>
<p>Although Quebec and the city of Montreal have larger job categories (e.g. professional, technician), this doesn’t seem to be the case for the federal government.</p>
