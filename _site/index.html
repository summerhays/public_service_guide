          <p>So, you’d like to get a job with the government. A few minutes of Googling the various websites may have left you utterly confused about how these various levels of government function – and for good reason, it <strong>is</strong> confusing. That said, if you’re like us, and were riddled with poverty for years, it can be an interesting opportunity. We’re relatively delighted with our work experiences.</p>

<p>This guide is based in Montreal and is based on conversations among friends, who have been trying to comprehend these bureaucracies and our place in them.</p>

<p>This guide contains a few tips for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/federal">The public service of Canada (federal)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/quebec">The public service of Quebec (provincial)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A few general considerations.</p>

<p>First, recommended reading is this Statistique Quebec report from 2021, which finds that the municipal governments of Quebec tend to <a href="https://statistique.quebec.ca/en/communique/total-compensation-of-quebec-government-employees-on-par-with-the-private-sector-but-behind-the-other-public-sectors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pay better and require less hours on the job</a> than either the federal and especially the provincial governments (here’s the <a href="https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/document/remuneration-des-salaries-etat-et-evolution-compares" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 version of this same report</a>, en français seulement).</p>

<p>That said, according to this same report, both the federal and the Quebec governments tend to pay better than the private sector, both unionized and non-unionized, in terms of the overall compensation, relative to the total number of hours worked. The federal government pays about 9% better on average than the Quebec government. Note, however: the private sector offers higher salaries, but demands more hours to earn it. In other words, the public service pays more per hour worked, particularly in global benefits.</p>

<p>Second, although the municipal government pays better overall, the Federal government offers more flexibility in terms of where one can work within Canada, and more opportunities to work abroad as well.</p>
