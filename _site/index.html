<p>So, you’d like to get a job with the government. A few minutes of Googling the various websites may have left you completely confused about how these various levels of government function – and for good reason, it’s confusing. That said, if you’re like us, and were riddled with poverty for years, it can be an interesting opportunity. We’re relatively delighted with our work experiences.</p>

<p>This guide is based in Montreal and is based on conversations among friends, who have been trying to comprehend these bureaucracies and our place in them.</p>

<p>This guide contains a few tips for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/federal">The public service of Canada (federal)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/quebec">The public service of Quebec (provincial)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A few general considerations.</p>

<p>First, recommended reading is this Statistique Quebec report from 2021, which finds that the municipal governments of Quebec tend to <a href="https://statistique.quebec.ca/en/communique/total-compensation-of-quebec-government-employees-on-par-with-the-private-sector-but-behind-the-other-public-sectors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pay better and require less hours on the job</a> than either the federal and especially the provincial governments (here’s the <a href="https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/document/remuneration-des-salaries-etat-et-evolution-compares" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 version of this same report</a>, en français seulement).</p>

<p>That said, according to this same report, the federal government tends to pay better than the private sector, both unionized and non-unionized, in terms of the overall compensation, relative to the total number of hours worked.</p>

<p>Second, although the municipal government pays better overall, the Federal government offers more flexibility in terms of where one can work within Canada, and more opportunities to work abroad as well.</p>

<p>Third, the overall compensation of employees within the Quebec public service tends to be about equal with the private sector, but with both lower overall salary and fewer hours worked. The benefits are not very appealing either.</p>
