So, you'd like to get a job with the government. Any government.

But a few minutes of Googling has left you utterly confused about how on earth to break into these institutions. We've been there.

That said, if you're like us (a.k.a. riddled with poverty for years), government work is a worthwhile opportunity. Looking back, we're (relatively) delighted with our work experiences.

This guide is based in Montreal, assumes that one could work both in English and in French, and is based on conversations among friends, who have been trying to comprehend these bureaucracies and our place in them.

* [The public service of Quebec (provincial)](/quebec)
* [The public service of the city of Montreal (municipal)](/montreal)
* [The public service of the city of Westmount (municipal)](/westmount)

But perhaps start by reading a few [general considerations](/general).
